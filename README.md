# schemefunctions
Some useful functions for scheme, made for an online scheme course. I do not know if they work outside of the course. 


Note: Please don't just copy these if you are in the course, they're actually a lot of fun to write. Also that's cheating and cheating is NOT COOL >:(.



Apparently I have to restate this:

Cheating is bad and you will get caught. You are in this to learn, not to get through. The code is now encrypted with a Super Secret 64 digit password. I will base future decisions off of this.
